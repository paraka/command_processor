= WTF is this =
This is just a stupid command parser and processor using
modern c++ features like std:function among others. It has
been thought to parse command from a chunk of bytes of data.
The only important think to know is that command is in the 
first byte. 

= Dependencies =
Modern c++ compiler (g++ >= 4.8)

= Compile =
$ mkdir build
$ cd build && cmake ..
$ make

= Compile unit tests =
Google test libraries are needed.

$ cd unit_tests
$ mkdir build
$ cd build && cmake ..
$ make
